# Chapter 1, Section 1: Introduction

This chapter provides a brief introduction to C++, we compile our first problem and learn some fundamentals of C++.

## The History of C++

C++ was designed to be a successor to C and it was originally designed in 1970 by Bjarne Stroustroup at Bell Labs in 1979. Since then, C++ has received many incremental improvements. C++ is an object orientated language, that implements concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism and encapsulation. The language also introduced Classes, which contain member data and member methods. These constructs exist to allow the programmer to model data and actions he wants to perform on such data with ease.

## The advantages of C++

C++ can be used for both high-level and low-level programming and allows developers to produce low-level applications that can manipulate the low-level functionality of hardware. Despite the fact many newer programming languages have come out since its release, such as Java, C++ has remained relevant and highly popular. The language remains is still the most popular choice for cases where accurate control over the application's resource consumption and performance is required (such as gaming or real-time mathematical simulations). C++ applications are also portable, but may need to be recompiled on different systems if different instruction sets are used.

## What is C++ used for?

C++ has been used for all kinds of different software, from video-games such as Half-life, through to the Linux Kernel, there are many pieces of popular software which have been written in C++. Here are some more examples of popular software packages which have been written in C++:

- Most of Adobe's software suite, including software such as Photoshop, ImageReady, Illustrator and Adobe Premier.
- Google has used C++ to create things such as the Google File System (this is used in Google's search engine) and Chromium.
- Firefox and Thunderbird mail client are both written in C++.
- Many operating systems are written in C++, including several versions of Windows and OSX.
- There are many, many more pieces of software which have been written in C++.

## Programming a C++ Application

C++ applications can be written using simple text-editors or complex IDE environments (such as Microsoft Visual Studio). When the code is written, it must be compiled using a compiler, which converts the source-code into machine-language, contained in object files. Finally, the object files are linked using a linker to get an executable (.exe on Windows).
